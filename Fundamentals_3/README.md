Solution to assignments
Let’s write some functions! Write these in the script tag of a skeleton HTML file. If you’ve forgotten how to set it up, review the instructions from Fundamentals Part 1.

For now, just write each function and test the output with console.log.

1. Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7. (see solution_1.html)

2. Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product. (see solution_2.html)

3. Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.(see solution_3.html)

4. Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
lastLetter("abcd") should return "d" (see solution_4.html)
